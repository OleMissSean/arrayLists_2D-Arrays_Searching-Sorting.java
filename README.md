CSci112.Lab2
============

Lab 2 (ArrayList, 2D-Arrays, Searching and Sorting) for CSci 112. I have taught this lab also.

Objectives:
- Working with ArrayList and 2D-arrays
- Searching and Sorting.

For this lab, you will need:
- 1 class (you can call it whatever you like) put all 3 parts below in the class.
- A "counter" (you can name it counter) varaible that can be incremented to go from 1 to some number.
- All 3 parts can be in the main method, or you can write them as separate methods called from the main method.

1. Using the "counter" variable
  A. Create a 2D integer array (5x5) and inseart numbers (use the "counter", just increment it for different numbers) to      fill it.
  B. Print the data held within so that the output looks like a grid.

2. You will need to reuse the counter (reinitialize it to equal 1) and an integer ArrayList.
  A. Using the counter andd 10-15 numbers to the ArrayList.
  B. Using a dot "." operator of the ArrayList:
    - Print the size of the ArrayList (how many elements are in the ArrayList)...
    - ...and the data held within.
  C. Then remove elements (2 and 5) from the ArrayList and repeat step B from above.

3. Create an integer array of size 10.
  A. Insert the numbers (6, 3, 8, 2, 10, 4, 9, 5, 10, 1) in that order.
  B. Sort the array using a selection sort.
  C. Use a binary search to search the array for the number 6: output whether the number was found or not.
  D. Then repeat C but search for the number 7.
